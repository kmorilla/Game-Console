# Game-Console
A project that allowed me to understand how to use and check for nulls in C#. I was able to learn about nullable value types with Nullable<T>, how to use the Null-Coalescing Operator and the Null-Conditional Operator. I was also able to learn how to use the Null Object Pattern by implementing it using interfaces or using an abstract class with a singel null instance.
